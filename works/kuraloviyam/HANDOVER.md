# HANDOVER — குறளோவியம்

Repository: `pugazg/kalaignar-literary-commentary`

Branch: `main`

Active work: `works/kuraloviyam/`

## LIVE MAIN IS AUTHORITATIVE

Fetch live `main` first. Preserve any newer durable Kuraloviyam state. Do not reopen completed Part 001 Tamil passes, first-pass English drafting, completed English source-check, or completed glossary-reconciliation batches because an older prompt or root handover records an earlier frontier.

For Kuraloviyam, this work-specific handover, `translations/en/TRANSLATION_STATUS.md`, `translations/en/GLOSSARY.md`, and `NEXT_CHAT_PROMPT_KURALOVIYAM.md` carry the current frontier.

## Mandatory startup

Read completely before Kuraloviyam changes:

1. `LITERARY_COMMENTARY_PROCESSING_GUIDE.md`
2. `KURALOVIYAM_ARCHIVAL_GUIDELINES.md`
3. root `HANDOVER.md`
4. `NEXT_CHAT_PROMPT_KURALOVIYAM.md`
5. this `works/kuraloviyam/HANDOVER.md`
6. `works/kuraloviyam/README.md`
7. `works/kuraloviyam/PART_001_AUDIT.md`
8. `works/kuraloviyam/PART_001_FINAL_STATUS_SYNC.md`
9. `works/kuraloviyam/metadata/source.md`

## Source family / per-part rule

- source ID: `TVA_BOK_0065733`;
- complete extent reported by user: **666 physical pages**;
- split ranges: 1–111, 112–222, 223–333, 334–444, 445–555, 556–666;
- repository `scan_page` never restarts per split.

Finish each supplied Part completely before beginning the next:

source intake → Pass 1 → Pass 2A → Pass 2B → Pass 3 → Part audit → final metadata/status sync → documentation sync → Tamil archival-ready → English translation/review closure → final Part checkpoint → next supplied Part.

## Part 001 Tamil — CLOSED

Part 001 scans **1–111** are Tamil archival-ready. Source intake and Passes 1/2A/2B/3 are complete; audit and final status sync are PASS. Tamil statuses are **107 `verified` + 4 `partial`**; partial scans are **13, 14, 15, 19**; visual fidelity is **111/111 `verified`**.

Do not reconstruct the unreadable handwritten bodies on scans 13–15 or the washed-out/faint printed region on scan 19. Normal English review uses the audited Tamil repository records; do not routinely reopen the Part 001 PDF.

The 111→112 boundary check remains deferred until Part 002 is supplied.

# Part 001 English project translation

The English layer is a **project-created translation**, not an official/publisher edition. Every English page declares `translation_type: "project_translation"`.

Permanent review cadence:

**draft → source-check → glossary reconciliation → editorial review → Part review → release report → release-ready**.

Review only from audited Tamil records. Do not import standard Kural wording, published English translations, web text, another commentator or memory.

The current user-directed normal iteration size is **15 consecutive physical scan pages**; a final Part remainder may be shorter.

## First-pass drafting — COMPLETE

All **111/111** English page records exist.

## Source-check — COMPLETE

All **111/111 physical scans** have been source-reviewed.

- SC1 / 1–15 — COMPLETE;
- SC2 / 16–30 — COMPLETE;
- SC3 / 31–45 — COMPLETE;
- SC4 / 46–60 — COMPLETE;
- SC5 / 61–75 — COMPLETE;
- SC6 / 76–90 — COMPLETE;
- SC7 / 91–105 — COMPLETE;
- SC8 / 106–111 — COMPLETE, final 6-page remainder.

Final source-check state:

- English page records: **111/111**;
- `source-checked`: **107**;
- `source-limited`: **4** — scans 13, 14, 15, 19; all four reviewed within available evidence;
- `draft`: **0**;
- editorial-reviewed: **0**;
- release-ready: **0**;
- unreadable source material reconstructed: **none**;
- external/standard Kural English imported: **none**.

## Glossary / recurring-terminology reconciliation

### GR1 — scans 1–15 — COMPLETE

All fifteen records were reconciled against audited Tamil context and `translations/en/GLOSSARY.md`.

- no English page wording corrections were required solely for GR1 consistency;
- source-supported controlled distinctions include `அணிந்துரை` / `மதிப்புரை` → **Foreword / Critical Appreciation**, `இன்பத்துப்பால்` / `காமத்துப்பால்` → **Book of Inbam / Book of Love**, `சூழ்நிலையுரை`, classical `akam` terminology, Valluvar Kottam, edition-preface labels, and source-evidenced names;
- scans 13–15 remain source-limited; no handwritten body terminology was inferred.

### GR2 — scans 16–30 — COMPLETE

All fifteen records were reconciled against audited Tamil context and the expanded glossary.

- `பதிப்புரை` → **Publisher's Note** was recorded and kept distinct from `பதவுரை` and `முகப்புரை`;
- the user-confirmed lexical clarification `பதவுரை` → **word-by-word explanation** was applied to the glossary and existing English scans **4–5**;
- scan **17** was corrected from **“Aram, Porul and Kamam”** to the controlled structural forms **“the Book of Aram, the Book of Porul and the Book of Love”** for `அறத்துப்பால், பொருட்பால், காமத்துப்பால்`;
- scan **30** now preserves the explicit source honorific as **Puratchi Kavignar Bharathidasan**, consistent with scan 19;
- context-aware differences such as `உரை` = commentary vs speech/address and `புதுக் கவிதை` = free verse vs new poetry are recorded rather than flattened mechanically;
- source-supported speaker/role and literary/prosodic terms from scans 16–30 were added to `GLOSSARY.md`;
- scan **19** remains `source-limited`; no term was inferred from its washed-out gap;
- no standard/published/web English Kural translation wording was imported.

Glossary reconciliation coverage: **30/111 scans**.

Page statuses remain **107 `source-checked` + 4 `source-limited`**. Glossary reconciliation does not itself promote pages to `editorial-reviewed`.

## Current exact activity

Proceed with **Part 001 glossary / recurring-terminology reconciliation GR3 — scans 31–45**:

1. fetch live `main` first;
2. process exactly **15 consecutive scans**;
3. fetch matching English and audited Tamil records for scans **31–45** as needed;
4. compare recurring names, controlled literary terms, chapter labels, publication/work names and repeated English renderings against the expanded `translations/en/GLOSSARY.md` and Tamil context;
5. add or refine glossary entries only where Part 001 evidence supports them;
6. do not mechanically force one English equivalent where context requires a different rendering;
7. do not import standard Thirukkural terminology, web text, published translations, another commentator or memory;
8. this gate does **not** itself promote pages to `editorial-reviewed`;
9. record terminology corrections transparently in affected English pages and `GLOSSARY.md`;
10. update `TRANSLATION_STATUS.md`, English/work README, handover and current prompt, then audit the exact changed-file set before advancing to GR4.

Do not begin Part 002 until Part 001 English/final closure is complete and Part 002 source is supplied.
